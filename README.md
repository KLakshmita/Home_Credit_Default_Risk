# Home_Credit_Default_Risk
With the increase in population across the globe, the need for loans has increased. Loans can be used in many ways, such as home loans, loans to start a business, and loans for education. For most banks, giving loans is a business and many major banks operate on this model. It is important for banks to determine whether an applicant can repay the loan or not. Banks cannot give loans to applicants who do not have the ability to repay the loan, as doing so may cause a bank to collapse. The repayment ability of an applicant can be estimated using factors such as the applicantâ€™s past credit history, current salary, bank balance, types, and value of any existing assets. A wide range and variety of information about the applicant will help the model to extract more expressive features from the data and apply effective models to fit the features.

The goal of this project is to use various machine learning models to predict the loan repayment ability of an applicant and to understand which machine learning models perform better compared to other models.
